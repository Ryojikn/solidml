# Solid for Machine Learning Engineers

This repo takes base upon the principles of SOLID considering the use case of Machine Learning tasks.
It's based on Valerio's Velardo mini course that can be viewed through this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul8LLiFY0Dw&list=PL-wATfeyAMNpZ6-ESiXK9BnZmGLjqECt9).

Each folder corresponds to a principle from solid:

**S = Single Responsibility Principle**
    - A module, a class, or a method should be responsible for a single functionality of a software system.

**O = Open Closed Principle**
    - Software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**L = Liskov Substitution Principle**
    - If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced by objects of type S, without disrupting the program.

**I = Interface Segregation Principle**
    - Client code shouldn't depend on method it doesn't use.
    Better to have multiple specific interfaces rather than a single general interface.

**D = Dependency Inversion Principle**
    - Classes should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
